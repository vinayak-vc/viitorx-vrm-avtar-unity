# Virtual Mirror — Architecture Decision Records

Add a new ADR for every major choice. Do not silently contradict Accepted ADRs.

---

## ADR-001 — Engine and stack

- **Status:** Accepted  
- **Date:** 2026-08-05  
- **Decision:** Unity 6 (2022 LTS fallback) + MediaPipe Tasks + VRM 1.0 (UniVRM) + URP  
- **Why:** Mature, cost-effective, VRoid-compatible avatars, single CV ecosystem for pose/face/hands  
- **Alternatives:** Unreal; MoveNet-only; custom avatar format  

---

## ADR-002 — IK backend

- **Status:** Accepted (V1)  
- **Decision:** Unity Animation Rigging as default `IIkSolver`; FinalIK optional later  
- **Why:** No mandatory commercial dependency for V1; interface allows upgrade  

---

## ADR-003 — Provider interfaces

- **Status:** Accepted  
- **Decision:** All tracking/avatar/IK/camera behind interfaces in Core  
- **Why:** Replaceability (vision §3.2); test fakes; depth cameras later  

---

## ADR-004 — Platform

- **Status:** Accepted  
- **Decision:** Windows x64 EXE only for V1  
- **Why:** Webcam + native MediaPipe story clearest; scope control  

---

## ADR-005 — Avatar format

- **Status:** Accepted  
- **Decision:** VRM 1.0 runtime load; ship built-ins + user file pick  
- **Why:** VTuber/VRoid ecosystem; hot-swap without rebuild  

---

## ADR-006 — Async / threading style

- **Status:** Proposed  
- **Decision:** TBD — UniTask vs Unity Awaitable vs Task  
- **Action:** Decide during M0/M1 before widespread async code  

---

## ADR-007 — Azure Kinect

- **Status:** Accepted  
- **Decision:** Do not design V1 around Azure Kinect  
- **Why:** Discontinued hardware; keep optional depth behind interface for RealSense/OAK-D later  

---

## ADR-008 — OpenCV

- **Status:** Accepted  
- **Decision:** Do not take OpenCV dependency unless calibration/preprocess requires it  
- **Why:** Reduce package surface; MediaPipe + Unity enough for V1

---

## ADR-009 — Assembly layout refinement (M0)

- **Status:** Accepted  
- **Date:** 2026-08-05  
- **Decision:** Split infrastructure out of the `Core`/`App` pair from SDS-002 §4 into two thin low-level assemblies so feature code can depend on them without a cycle:
  - `VirtualMirror.Core` — interfaces + models + events only (refs UnityEngine). Holds `IPathProvider`, `ILogService`, `LogLevel`.
  - `VirtualMirror.IO` (refs Core) — `PathProvider`, `LogService`.
  - `VirtualMirror.Settings` (refs Core, IO) — `AppSettings` (+ nested groups), `SettingsSchema`, `SettingsStore`.
  - `VirtualMirror.App` (refs Core, IO, Settings) — composition root: `AppBootstrap`, `ServiceRegistry`.
- **Why:** `SettingsStore`/`LogService` are infrastructure needed by future feature assemblies (Tracking, Avatar, UI). Placing them in `App` (which references features) would invert the dependency. They cannot live in `Core` (Core must stay interface/model-only, and `AppSettings` would drag concretes in). Two dedicated infra assemblies keep the dependency graph acyclic and match the layer diagram (Infrastructure = files/logs at the bottom).
- **Consequence:** Feature asmdefs (`.Tracking`, `.Retargeting`, `.IK`, `.Avatar`, `.UI`, `.Editor`, `.Tests`) are created lazily as their code lands, to avoid empty assemblies.

---

## ADR-006 — Async / threading style

- **Status:** Accepted (2026-08-05, at start of M1)  
- **Decision:** Use **Unity Awaitable** (`UnityEngine.Awaitable` / `Awaitable<T>`) as the public async return type across the codebase. Await `Task`-based third-party APIs (e.g. UniVRM `Vrm10.LoadPathAsync`) directly inside `async Awaitable` methods.  
- **Why:** Native to Unity 6 (no extra dependency, unlike UniTask), low-allocation (fits AGENTS perf rules), first-class `CancellationToken` support, main-thread friendly. Keeps V1 free of another pinned package.  
- **Consequence:** `IAvatarLoader.LoadAsync` returns `Awaitable<AvatarLoadResult>`. UniTask stays optional (SDS-019 §2) and is not taken unless a concrete need appears.  
- **M0 note:** `SettingsStore` remains synchronous atomic write + debounce `Tick` — no async needed there.

---

## ADR-010 — MediaPipe backend

- **Status:** Accepted (2026-08-05, M2 kickoff)  
- **Decision:** Use **homuler MediaPipeUnityPlugin** (`com.github.homuler.mediapipe`) as the MediaPipe Tasks backend for Pose (and later Face/Hands). Real provider = `MediaPipePoseProvider : IBodyTrackingProvider`, consuming `ICameraCapture` frames.  
- **Why:** It is the de-facto "MediaPipe Tasks" for Unity — full PoseLandmarker (33 BlazePose landmarks + world landmarks) and one ecosystem that also covers Face + Hands (M3). Matches SDS-003/009/025 directly. Alternative (Unity Sentis + BlazePose ONNX) needs a full custom re-implementation of the MediaPipe graph.  
- **Cost / consequence:** Heavy native plugin (~hundreds MB), installed via the GitHub-release `.unitypackage` (not clean UPM). The plugin is imported manually by the user; the provider is written against its `PoseLandmarker` API. Until it is installed, the pipeline runs on `FakeBodyTrackingProvider`.  
- **Isolation:** Only `MediaPipePoseProvider` (Tracking asmdef) references the plugin. `IBodyTrackingProvider`, `PoseFrame`, retarget, and IK never reference MediaPipe types (SDS-009 §11).

## Capture source note (M2)

Development input is a **video file** (`VideoFileCaptureService`, `sampleVRMFiles/sample video.mp4`) rather than a live webcam, selected via `AppBootstrap.useVideoSource`. `WebcamCaptureService` exists and is swapped in by flipping that flag. Both implement `ICameraCapture`; tracking providers are agnostic to the source.
